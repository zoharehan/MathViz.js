<h3>Addition & Subtraction Visualisation</h3>
<!-- style this div to be inline block -->
<div class="addSubtDemoContainer">

    <div class="visual">

        <div class="addSubtQuestionVisual">

                    were sleeping together. Now, 2 woke up and left. How many kittens do we have left?

            Click on the equals sign to see results and click on it again to hide them!
            <br>
            You can also hover over the items to see additional information, in this case, the
            numbers being represented :)
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the description at the bottom as well as the choice between cats and dogs can be customised
            by the developer.

<h3>Interative Fraction Visualisations</h3>

<div class="fracDemoContainer">
    <div id="fracDemoQuestion">
        <p>
            You and your friend just bought a pizza with 6 slices.
            If your friend eats three slices, how much of the pizza 
            has your friend eaten in fraction form? What if the pizza had 7 slices? 8?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="FracDemoVisuals">
        <div id="fracDemoVisual">
            <!-- add visual here -->
        </div>
        <div id="fracDemoVisual1">

        </div>
        <div id="fracDemoVisual2">
            
        </div>


    </div>
  
    <p>
        Click on slices to see how the fraction changes :)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the developer can customise the total slices, filled slices and fill color!
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Matrix-Scalar Multiplication Step-by-Step Visualisations</h3>
<p>New to Matrices? Our library's interactive animations makes the familiarisation
    process easier!
</p>
<div id="matrixScalarDemoVisual">
    <!-- add visual here -->
</div>
<p>
    Click on the "Next Step" button to walk through the steps taken to multiply a scalar with
    a matrix!
    <br>
    <br>
    Once you finish going through the steps, you'll be informed through an alert. 
    <br>
    If you want to go over them
    again, simply press "OK" and then click on the "Next Step" button to start the visualisation from the beginning!
</p>
<p>
    Note that the developer can customise the scalar, matrix dimensions and values to better suit their task :)
</p>

<h3>Stumbling on Matrix Multiplication?</h3>
<p>
    Not to worry! Our library's Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Visualiser is here to help
    and just one simple function call away!
</p>
<div id="matrixMatrixDemoVisual">
    <!-- add visual here -->
</div>
<p>
    Click on the "Next Step" button to walk through the steps taken to multiply two matrices!
    <br>
    Every click highlights the row and column being multiplied together as well as the result cell they correspond to.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the developer can customise the matrices' dimensions and values to better suit their task :)
